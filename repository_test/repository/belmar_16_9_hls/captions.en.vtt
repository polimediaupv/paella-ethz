00:00:01.570 --> 00:00:04.230
in line with

2
00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:13.840
better at the 
moment than it comes to

3
00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:23.830
throughout 
the day to whatever

4
00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:36.860
to whatever it is to us

5
00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:40.550
what interests us already

6
00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:49.270
move on to what 
it will be and if

7
00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:59.740
if you haven't 
already been to it

8
00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:07.480
seven and passes to four

9
00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:18.500
I do it now I'm not going to if 
well if it's not easy what you wrote it

10
00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:31.870
I'm sorry I 
don't because I come to

11
00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:42.930
I don't know 
again that it's going to

12
00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:59.830
if it's not going to be how

13
00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:13.720
I'm not 
going to write it or

14
00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:22.500
going to not go to

15
00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:41.890
imagine 
already to the way in

16
00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:46.780
that goes to four

17
00:02:48.310 --> 00:03:00.540
five to four to 
four to half a point

18
00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:09.370
a goes to 
physics that are within

19
00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:14.360
we're not 
going to class here

20
00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:20.270
a a tomorrow to which

21
00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:41.020
will have no house surely 
yes early in the morning I will

22
00:03:42.420 --> 00:04:22.870
use it to

23
00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:55.220
he's going to not go to me

24
00:04:58.390 --> 00:05:01.110
come on for forty minutes

25
00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:21.540
walks to wonder to

26
00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:32.450
it goes to when you

27
00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:44.330
it's going to come and

28
00:05:46.090 --> 00:06:43.280
going to ya 
va a tengo e a a

29
00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:55.710
a a a is not going to

30
00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:06.210
a and I'm going to 
study the tangent on the right

31
00:07:09.010 --> 00:07:09.470
e

32
00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:48.780
to now will not leave 
will not escape will not

33
00:07:50.830 --> 00:09:24.180
happens to a a not 
if you are going to a

34
00:09:29.730 --> 00:09:49.340
a e of capacitors

35
00:09:52.310 --> 00:09:55.880
you are going to see that it is 
a very fast topic with few concepts

36
00:09:57.370 --> 00:10:00.250
you can work it out

37
00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:03.540
in a week you 
can work well and

38
00:10:04.990 --> 00:10:10.040
well let's see the 
definition of a capacitor work only

39
00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:13.940
the flat capacitor what 
happens to it capacitor when we put a

40
00:10:14.340 --> 00:10:16.110
insulating material inside

41
00:10:17.510 --> 00:10:21.750
can be a plastic can be any 
material that does not have free electrons

42
00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:27.290
e how to work an association of 
capacitors that is an association

43
00:10:27.930 --> 00:10:32.040
to stored energy and 
some interesting applications

44
00:10:33.930 --> 00:10:35.730
that we will see to

45
00:10:37.250 --> 00:10:38.140
_ _ EMPTY _ _

46
00:10:41.110 --> 00:10:45.330
a capacitor is always a 
pair of conductors with influence

47
00:10:45.330 --> 00:10:46.330
electrostatic

48
00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:51.880
and here we connect a little what 
we have worked on the previous topic

49
00:10:52.390 --> 00:10:53.900
when we have two drivers

50
00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:55.980
and total influence

51
00:10:58.580 --> 00:11:02.340
that is to say that the entire 
electric field field line of conductor one

52
00:11:02.710 --> 00:11:03.960
arrives at the driver two

53
00:11:05.020 --> 00:11:08.270
that is what happens 
because the burden that there is in

54
00:11:08.490 --> 00:11:12.240
the surface are equal 
and of opposite sign is valid

55
00:11:12.850 --> 00:11:17.220
good to those two 
surfaces with identical load

56
00:11:17.220 --> 00:11:20.640
but contrary sign are 
called armor of a capacitor worth

57
00:11:22.020 --> 00:11:24.510
and then 
there's a parameter

58
00:11:25.190 --> 00:11:26.240
that characterizes

59
00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:29.630
a capacitor which is 
what is called the capacity

60
00:11:30.530 --> 00:11:34.030
which is defined 
as the burden we have

61
00:11:34.550 --> 00:11:36.990
in armor in charge q

62
00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:41.790
divided by the difference in 
potential between the two conduits

63
00:11:42.770 --> 00:11:47.140
_ _ EMPTY _ _

64
00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:48.870
_ _ EMPTY _ _

65
00:11:51.710 --> 00:11:56.440
this definition

66
00:11:57.670 --> 00:12:03.680
it is an invariable always 
invariable in any only dependent capacitor

67
00:12:03.940 --> 00:12:06.440
of the geometry of the 
capacitor with which we are working

68
00:12:08.210 --> 00:12:11.220
this depends on

69
00:12:20.660 --> 00:12:25.170
and as it depends only on the 
geometry we put cylindrical or flat

70
00:12:25.590 --> 00:12:27.710
because basically
 it is always

71
00:12:33.620 --> 00:12:38.510
an invariable worth we can 
increase the difference in power

72
00:12:38.660 --> 00:12:40.410
automatically 
increase the load

73
00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:45.150
we can decrease the load 
automatically will decrease the potential difference

74
00:12:45.350 --> 00:12:48.560
but value is the quotient 
always comes out a constant number

75
00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:50.270
which depends 
on the geometry

76
00:12:51.140 --> 00:12:53.990
if we do not vary the 
geometry of the capacitor start itself

77
00:12:53.990 --> 00:12:56.210
that's what it means

78
00:12:57.770 --> 00:13:00.950
the unit of 
measure is the Faradio

79
00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:06.260
Faradio who is a culomb

80
00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:08.870
divided by a volt

81
00:13:10.490 --> 00:13:13.660
what happens that as 
you see in practice are used

82
00:13:13.660 --> 00:13:16.300
the derived 
nanopharadio units the

83
00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:19.110
microfaradio vale

84
00:13:23.310 --> 00:13:29.130
e in the case of a flat 
capacitor you have here drawn

85
00:13:30.090 --> 00:13:32.550
it's a case of how we've 
talked about influence before

86
00:13:32.550 --> 00:13:36.450
total electrostatic as 
long as the separation distance

87
00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:40.670
between plate armor 
is very small compared to

88
00:13:40.670 --> 00:13:43.030
the dimensions of 
the plates compared

89
00:13:43.570 --> 00:13:47.020
with the 
sides of the surface

90
00:13:48.460 --> 00:13:52.970
if it 's very small, it' s 
theoretically the same thing as approaching.

91
00:13:52.970 --> 00:13:54.670
to the ideal 
case of infinite plates

92
00:13:55.750 --> 00:13:58.860
then the total influence of 
the electric field always goes

93
00:13:59.070 --> 00:14:01.130
from positive charge 
to negative we will go

94
00:14:02.470 --> 00:14:06.130
well then let's as I 
said before we focus alone

95
00:14:06.130 --> 00:14:07.170
in the capacitor

96
00:14:11.990 --> 00:14:14.650
and

97
00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:21.700
and

98
00:14:26.300 --> 00:14:29.730
you have it 
there perfectly drawn

99
00:14:29.730 --> 00:14:34.610
let's learn how the capacitor 
capacity is calculated if we have

100
00:14:34.980 --> 00:14:37.790
two flat plates

101
00:14:41.590 --> 00:14:43.640
e and

102
00:14:45.060 --> 00:14:50.410
e parallels are 
connected to a source

103
00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:53.300
to a battery

104
00:14:54.390 --> 00:14:57.780
and that battery what it does 
is keep the potential difference

105
00:14:58.120 --> 00:14:59.760
between driver 
one and the cont
